									<p>cmmnt is a web and mobile application for sharing and discussing links privately
										You can send a person or group a link to an article, video, tweet, or picture, and
										start a private conversation around it. There is also a chrome extension to make 
										sending links easier.
									</p>
									<p>cmmnt is built on a Ruby on Rails backend using Zurb Foundation. The chrome extension
										is just vanilla Javascript. The apps are both native (in Java and Objective-C), but use a
										hybrid of native navigation and webviews to lay out the content to speed up development
										time considerably.

									<p>I spend my senior year at BU investing in and helping student-led startups through

										I was on the first Boston team along with colleagues from other area schools.
									</p>
									<p>After spending some time as an entrepreneur, I found it very valuable to get a perspective
										from the other side of the equation. I also really enjoyed the opportunity to help out my
										peers since I could really relate to what they were doing.

									<p>Credport was a company that I started with my good friend <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nambrot">Nam</a> during our sophomore year at BU. We were fascinated by the rise of
										marketplaces and collaborative consumption and believed that we could build a portable
										reputation to take around the web.
									</p>
									<p>We took part in the Summer@Highland program with Highland Capital, and then were 
										accepted into Startupbootcamp Berlin so we took a leave of absence during our junior year
										to move to Berlin and work on Credport. We talked to tons of marketplaces and released a
										product with a few partners, but then realized that we couldn't grow a userbase so
										we shut the company down and returned to school.

										at BU, and eventually organized a hackathon in the spring of 2014. We had
										over 100 attendees and a really great time.

									<p>At a hackathon, Battlehack Boston, I built a Late Night Safety Kit with a few friends.
										It is a mobile application which provides a few different tools for people to feel safe
										at night, including crime in the local area, a timer to contact people in case you
										don't make it home, and a tracker. We ended up

										Lab at BU.
									</p>
									<p>I used Altium Designer to design the printed circuit board which held all the LEDs and
										the circuit. It was connected to Arduino, which had a Bluetooth Low Energy module to
										communicate with an Android app.
